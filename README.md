# The Bitnami Library for Kubernetes - FULL INDEX - https://bitnami.techfreak.ch/bitnami

Popular applications, provided by [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com), ready to launch on Kubernetes using [Kubernetes Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm).

This is a copy of the full index, after Bitnami's policy of only keeping 6-months in the official index. See [THIS GitHub Issue](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/10539)

The full index is still GENERATED by bitnami, and is taken from here: [archive-full-index](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/archive-full-index)

It is just not provided on CDN and easy-to-access URL.

## TL;DR

```bash
$ helm repo add bitnami https://bitnami.techfreak.ch/bitnami
$ helm search repo bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/<chart>
```

For more details, see the [Official Bitnami GitHub](https://github.com/bitnami/charts)
